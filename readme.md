# Systematic Program Design (UBCx SPD1x) â€“ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **Systematic Program Design** (SPD) course (UBCx SPD1x, delivered via edX). This course, offered by the University of British Columbia, teaches a **design-first approach** to programming using Racket (BSL/ISL) rather than focusing on syntax of a specific language :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

##  Course Overview

The SPD course is structured into three parts (each ~5 weeks long), covering progressively complex design techniques:

- **Part 1**: Core design recipes:
  - How to Design Functions (HtDF)
  - How to Design Data (HtDD)
  - How to Design Worlds (HtDW)
  - Simple interactive programs and compound data :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Part 2**: Arbitrary-sized data (e.g., lists, trees), helper functions, local definitions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Part 3**: Abstraction, generative recursion, search algorithms, accumulators, and graph-based problems :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
